# Neural Network Toolkit

Build your own artificial neural network, from basic up to complex!

...when I started learning about ann's I kind of missed an easy-to-understand structured manual with codes, vizualisations and explanations for complete dl rookies. 
You'll find a step by step guide, ideas for projects and Tensforflow's endless list of data sets, that you can use to bring your ann to life.

# 2. Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)


I heartily welcome any possible improvements =] 


Happy programming ^.^
