# Neural Network Toolkit

Build your own artificial neural network, from basic up to complex!

...when I started learning about ann's I kind of missed an easy-to-understand structured manual with codes, visualizations and explanations for complete dl rookies. 
So here you'll find a step-by-step guide, ideas for first projects and Tensforflow's endless list of data sets, that you can use to bring your ann to life.
